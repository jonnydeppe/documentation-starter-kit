# Lunul: Earning Projections

---

## **1. Fee Projection Thesis**

### **Core Philosophy**
Lunul aims to sustain network operations and incentivize validators while maintaining ultra-low fees to ensure accessibility and scalability. The fee structure is designed to:
1. Provide a cost-efficient platform for high-volume transactions.
2. Support the network’s operations and incentivize validators.
3. Ensure predictable and sustainable revenue streams for long-term growth.

### **Fee Breakdown**

#### **1. Transaction Fees**
- **Base Fee:** $0.0002 per transaction.
  - Applies to standard transfers and simple interactions.
- **Smart Contract Execution Fees:** $0.002 to $0.01 per transaction.
  - Varies depending on computational complexity.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Fees dynamically adjust based on network activity to prevent congestion and prioritize critical transactions.

#### **2. Bridge Fees**
- **Cross-Chain Transfers:** 0.2% fee for wrapping and unwrapping assets.
  - Example: Wrapping BTC to Lunul’s private token or vice versa.
- **Minimum Fee:** $10 for high-value transfers to ensure liquidity stability.

#### **3. Validator Rewards**
- Validators earn 85% of transaction and bridge fees to sustain network security and incentivize participation.
- Remaining 15% contributes to a **sustainability fund** for ecosystem growth and infrastructure upgrades.

---

### **Revenue Projection (3-Year Estimate)**
#### **Assumptions:**
- **Daily Transactions:** 2 million transactions within the first year, increasing to 8 million by Year 3.
- **Average Fee per Transaction:** $0.001.
- **Bridge Transactions:** 20,000 transactions/day at an average of $20 fee.

#### **Yearly Revenue:**
| Revenue Source       | Year 1          | Year 2           | Year 3           |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Transaction Fees     | $730,000        | $1,460,000       | $2,920,000       |
| Bridge Fees          | $146,000        | $292,000         | $730,000         |
| **Total Revenue**    | **$876,000**    | **$1,752,000**   | **$3,650,000**   |

## **2. Tokenomics**

### **Native Token: LUN**
LUN is the native utility and governance token for Lunul, designed to:
- Facilitate network transactions.
- Incentivize validator participation.
- Support governance and decision-making.

### **Supply Overview**
- **Total Supply:** 1 billion LUN.
- **Initial Distribution:**
  - Community Rewards: 10%.
  - Ecosystem Incentives: 10%.
  - Validator Rewards: 10%.
  - Investors: 10%.
  - Team and Advisors: 10%.
  - Marketing and Partnerships: 10%.
  - Reserve Fund: 5%.
  - Liquidity and Market Operations: 35%.

### **Emissions Plan**
#### **Validator Incentives:**
- 10% of the total supply (150 million LUN) is unlocked yearly over the first three years to reward early validators.
- Validators also receive 85% of transaction and bridge fees, directly boosting their earnings.

#### **Community Rewards:**
- 20 million LUN released annually through staking rewards, airdrops, and grants.
- Rewards reduce by 5% per year to align with token scarcity principles.

#### **Investor Allocation:**
- 10% of the total supply (100 million LUN) is allocated to early investors.
- Investors purchasing tokens during the $5M seed round will receive tokens at a fixed rate of $0.05 per LUN.
- **Vesting Schedule:**
  - 25% unlocked at launch.
  - Remaining 75% vested linearly over 2 years to align incentives with long-term growth.

#### **Team and Advisor Vesting:**
- 10% allocation vests over 4 years with a 1-year cliff.
- Ensures long-term alignment with the project’s success.

### **Validator Details**
- **Minimum Staking Requirement:** 10,000 LUN to operate a validator node.
- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - High-performance CPUs with 16+ cores.
  - Minimum 64GB RAM and SSD storage.
  - Reliable high-bandwidth internet connection (1Gbps).
- **Rewards Distribution:**
  - 85% of transaction and bridge fees.
  - Additional rewards from the validator incentives pool.
- **Operational Costs:**
  - Estimated monthly operational cost: $500 - $1,000 per validator node.
- **ROI Projections:**
  - Average annual earnings per validator (Year 1): $15,000 - $20,000.
  - Increasing to $50,000+ by Year 3 with network growth.

---

### **Utility and Governance**
- **Transaction Fees:** LUN is used to pay all network fees.
- **Staking:** Validators and delegators stake LUN to secure the network and earn rewards.
- **Governance:** Token holders vote on protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and ecosystem funding.
- **Bridge Operations:** LUN powers bridge fees and liquidity provisioning.

---

### **Economic Sustainability**
- **Deflationary Measures:**
  - A portion of fees (10%) is burned to reduce circulating supply over time.
- **Fee Recycling:**
  - Remaining fees fund ecosystem growth and validator incentives.

---

### **Future Use Cases**
- Integration into privacy-focused DeFi protocols (e.g., lending, DEXs).
- Powering NFT marketplaces with anonymous transactions.
- Serving as a settlement currency for cross-chain asset transfers.

---

## **3. Governance Model**

### **Decentralized Governance**
- LUN holders participate in governance via a quadratic voting system to:
  - Approve upgrades.
  - Adjust transaction fees and validator rewards.
  - Allocate ecosystem funds.

---

### **Proposed Voting Mechanism**
1. **Proposal Submission:** Any token holder can submit a proposal by staking a minimum amount of LUN.
2. **Voting Period:** Proposals are open for voting over a 14-day period.
3. **Approval Threshold:** A proposal passes with at least 60% of the vote and a minimum quorum of 25% token participation.
