Lunul is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high-performance network
that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments,
and gaming. Lunul operates as a single global state machine and is open,
interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started

Dive right into Lunul to start building or setting up your local environment.

- [Quick Start](/docs/intro/quick-start) - Build and deploy your first on-chain
  Lunul program, directly in your browser using Lunul Playground
- [Setup Local Environment](/docs/intro/installation) - Install the Lunul CLI
  to get your local development environment setup

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Lunul different
from other blockchains.

- [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts) - Data and state storage mechanism for Lunul
- [Fees on Lunul](/docs/core/fees) - Various costs associated with using the
  network.
- [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions) - Collection of instructions for the
  blockchain to execute
- [Programs](/docs/core/programs) - The executable code used to perform actions
  on the blockchain
- [Programs Derived Address](/docs/core/pda) - Deterministically generated
  addresses that allow Lunul programs to programmatically "sign" transactions.
- [Cross Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi) - Core of the "composability" of
  Lunul, this is how programs can "call" each other.

## Understanding the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain
works.

- [Validators](https://docs.anza.xyz/validator/anatomy) - the individual nodes
  that are the backbone of the network
- [Clusters](/docs/core/clusters) - a collection of validators that work
  together for consensus

## Running a validator

Explore what it takes to operate a Lunul validator and help secure the network.

- [System Requirements](https://docs.anza.xyz/operations/requirements) -
  Recommended hardware requirements and expected LUN needed to operate a
  validator
- [Quick Start](https://docs.anza.xyz/operations/setup-a-validator) - Setup a
  validator and get connected to a cluster for the first time

## Why Lunul?

Designed to scale, Lunul is purpose-built for blockchain applications to reach
millions of users. Instead of worrying about optimizing for the blockchain
layer, developers can focus on building their applications to reach product
market fit. Not only can it scale now for blockchain application needs, but the
network continues to be optimized with user experience in mind.

Building the best user experience in an application is a top priority for
developers. With blockchains, the user experience is often limited by the
underlying technology, causing slow response times and high fees. Lunul's low
fees and 400ms confirmation times enable developers to build applications that
are user-friendly and accessible to everyone.

## Lunul Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onchain Program Development | The ability to develop and deploy programs onchain. Users can interact with these programs permissionlessly, removing the need for middleman servers to build applications.                                                   |
| 400ms Slot Times            | Every transaction sent by users on Lunul is confirmed in a block. With a target slot time of 400ms for each block, interactions by users do not have to wait, providing the best in class user experience of any blockchain. |
| Low Fees                    | Fees on Lunul are well known to be low. With a median fee of 0.00064 LUN per transaction, Lunul enables building for users across the world regardless of background.                                                       |
| High Throughput             | Scaling to thousands of transactions per second, Lunul is built to scale with your application's user needs.                                                                                                                 |

## How to Use These Docs

On the left, you will find the docs sidebar. This lists the documentation in
order from basic to more advanced information. If you are new to Lunul, we
recommend starting from the top and working your way down. However, you're
welcome to read them in any order that you like.

Once you're ready to start building, check out the
[Quick Start](/docs/intro/quick-start) guide.
