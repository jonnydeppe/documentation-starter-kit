# Lunul: Project Overview

---

## **Introduction**

Lunul is a privacy-enhanced blockchain designed to combine unparalleled speed, scalability, and anonymity. Built on Solanaâ€™s high-performance framework, Lunul integrates cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof technologies (zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs) to deliver a platform that prioritizes user privacy without compromising performance.

## **Key Features**

- **Privacy by Default:** Every transaction is anonymized using advanced zero-knowledge proofs and stealth addresses.
- **Unmatched Performance:** Processes over 65,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality.
- **Low-Cost Transactions:** Average fees are less than $0.01, making the platform accessible to all users.
- **Interoperability:** Native bridges enable private and secure transfers across multiple blockchains.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Token holders influence protocol upgrades and ecosystem decisions.

## **LUN Token**

The native token of Lunul, LUN, powers the ecosystem by enabling transactions, staking, and governance. The tokenomics are designed to incentivize network participation while ensuring long-term economic sustainability.

- **Total Supply:** 1 billion LUN.
- **Deflationary Mechanism:** A portion of transaction fees is burned to reduce circulating supply over time.
- **Distribution:** Allocated to community rewards, validator incentives, investors, and ecosystem growth.
