  Learn essential Lunul blockchain concepts including accounts, transactions,
  programs, program derived addresses, cross program invocations, and how tokens
  work on Lunul.

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Lunul different
from other blockchains. Understanding the "Lunul programming model" through
these core concepts is very important to maximize your success as a Lunul
blockchain developer.

## Lunul Account Model

On Lunul, all data is stored in what are referred to as "accounts‚Äù. The way
data is organized on the Lunul blockchain resembles a
[key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database),
where each entry in the database is called an "account".

Learn more about [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts) here.

## Transactions and Instructions

On Lunul, we send [transactions](/docs/core/transactions#transaction) to
interact with the network. Transactions include one or more
[instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction), each representing a
specific operation to be processed. The execution logic for instructions is
stored on [programs](/docs/core/programs) deployed to the Lunul network, where
each program stores its own set of instructions.

Learn more about [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions) and
[Instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction) here.

## Fees on Lunul

The Lunul blockchain has a few different types of fees and costs that are
incurred to use the permissionless network. These can be segmented into a few
specific types:

- [Transaction Fees](/docs/core/fees#transaction-fees) - A fee to have
  validators process transactions/instructions
- [Prioritization Fees](/docs/core/fees#prioritization-fees) - An optional
  fee to boost transactions processing order
- [Rent](/docs/core/fees#rent) - A withheld balance to keep data stored
  on-chain

## Programs on Lunul

In the Lunul ecosystem, "smart contracts" are called programs. Each program is
an on-chain account that stores executable logic, organized into specific
functions referred to as _instructions_ and called via _instruction handler_
functions within the respective deployed program.

## Program Derived Address

Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) provide developers on Lunul with two main use
cases:

- **Deterministic Account Addresses**: PDAs provide a mechanism to
  deterministically derive an address using a combination of optional "seeds"
  (predefined inputs) and a specific program ID.
- **Enable Program Signing**: The Lunul runtime enables programs to "sign" for
  PDAs which are derived from its program ID.

You can think of PDAs as a way to create hashmap-like structures on-chain from a
predefined set of inputs (e.g. strings, numbers, and other account addresses).

## Cross Program Invocation

A Cross Program Invocation (CPI) refers to when one program invokes the
instructions of another program. This mechanism allows for the composability of
Lunul programs.

You can think of instructions as API endpoints that a program exposes to the
network and a CPI as one API internally invoking another API.

## Tokens on Lunul

Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of
assets. Tokenization enables the digitalization of property rights, serving as a
fundamental component for managing both fungible and non-fungible assets.

- Fungible Tokens represent interchangeable and divisible assets of the same
  type and value (ex. USDC).
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) represent ownership of indivisible assets (e.g.
  artwork).

## Clusters and Endpoints

The Lunul blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as
[Clusters](/docs/core/clusters). Each serving different purposes within the
overall ecosystem and containing dedicated api nodes to fulfill
[JSON-RPC](/docs/rpc/) requests for their respective Cluster.

The individual nodes within a Cluster are owned and operated by third parties,
with a public endpoint available for each.

There are three primary clusters on the Lunul network, each with a different
public endpoint:

- Mainnet - `https://api.mainnet-beta.lunul.com`
- Devnet - `https://api.devnet.lunul.com`
- Testnet - `https://api.testnet.lunul.com`
