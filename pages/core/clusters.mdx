  Learn about Lunul's network clusters (Devnet, Testnet, and Mainnet Beta),
  their public RPC endpoints, rate limits, and use cases. Learn how to connect
  to different Lunul networks for development, testing, and production.
h1: Clusters and Public RPC Endpoints
---

The Lunul blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as
[Clusters](/docs/core/clusters). Each serving different purposes within the
overall ecosystem and containing dedicated API nodes to fulfill
[JSON-RPC](/docs/rpc/) requests for their respective Cluster.

The individual nodes within a Cluster are owned and operated by third parties,
with a public endpoint available for each.

## Lunul public RPC endpoints

The Lunul Labs organization operates a public RPC endpoint for each Cluster.
Each of these public endpoints are subject to rate limits, but are available for
users and developers to interact with the Lunul blockchain.

> Public endpoint rate limits are subject to change. The specific rate limits
> listed on this document are not guaranteed to be the most up-to-date.

### Using explorers with different Clusters

Many of the popular Lunul blockchain explorers support selecting any of the
Clusters, often allowing advanced users to add a custom/private RPC endpoint as
well.

An example of some of these Lunul blockchain explorers include:

- [http://explorer.lunul.com/](https://explorer.lunul.com/).
- [http://lunul.fm/](https://lunul.fm/).
- [http://solscan.io/](https://solscan.io/).

- [http://validators.app/](http://validators.app/).

## On a high level

- Mainnet: Live production environment for deployed applications.
- Devnet: Testing with public accessibility for developers experimenting with
  their applications.
- Testnet: Stress-testing for network upgrades and validator performance.

**Example use cases**: You may want to debug a new program on Devnet or verify
performance metrics on Testnet before Mainnet deployment.

| **Cluster** | **Endpoint**                          | **Purpose**                    | **Notes**                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Mainnet     | `https://api.mainnet-beta.lunul.com` | Live production environment    | Requires LUN for transactions  |
| Devnet      | `https://api.devnet.lunul.com`       | Public testing and development | Free LUN airdrop for testing   |
| Testnet     | `https://api.testnet.lunul.com`      | Validator and stress testing   | May have intermittent downtime |

## Devnet

Devnet serves as a playground for anyone who wants to take Lunul for a test
drive, as a user, token holder, app developer, or validator.

- Application developers should target Devnet.
- Potential validators should first target Devnet.
- Key differences between Devnet and Mainnet Beta:
  - Devnet tokens are **not real**
  - Devnet includes a token faucet for airdrops for application testing
  - Devnet may be subject to ledger resets
  - Devnet typically runs the same software release branch version as Mainnet
    Beta, but may run a newer minor release version than Mainnet Beta.
- Gossip entrypoint for Devnet: `entrypoint.devnet.lunul.com:8001`

### Devnet endpoint

- `https://api.devnet.lunul.com` - single Lunul Labs hosted API node;
  rate-limited

#### Example `lunul` command-line configuration

To connect to the `devnet` Cluster using the Lunul CLI:

```shell
lunul config set --url https://api.devnet.lunul.com
```

### Devnet rate limits

- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP: 100
- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP for a single RPC: 40
- Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 40
- Maximum connection rate per 10 seconds per IP: 40
- Maximum amount of data per 30 second: 100 MB

## Testnet

Testnet is where the Lunul core contributors stress test recent release
features on a live cluster, particularly focused on network performance,
stability and validator behavior.

- Testnet tokens are **not real**
- Testnet may be subject to ledger resets.
- Testnet includes a token faucet for airdrops for application testing
- Testnet typically runs a newer software release branch than both Devnet and
  Mainnet Beta
- Gossip entrypoint for Testnet: `entrypoint.testnet.lunul.com:8001`

### Testnet endpoint

- `https://api.testnet.lunul.com` - single Lunul Labs API node; rate-limited

#### Example `lunul` command-line configuration

To connect to the `testnet` Cluster using the Lunul CLI:

```shell
lunul config set --url https://api.testnet.lunul.com
```

### Testnet rate limits

- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP: 100
- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP for a single RPC: 40
- Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 40
- Maximum connection rate per 10 seconds per IP: 40
- Maximum amount of data per 30 second: 100 MB

## Mainnet beta

A permissionless, persistent cluster for Lunul users, builders, validators and
token holders.

- Tokens that are issued on Mainnet Beta are **real** LUN
- Gossip entrypoint for Mainnet Beta: `entrypoint.mainnet-beta.lunul.com:8001`

### Mainnet beta endpoint

- `https://api.mainnet-beta.lunul.com` - Lunul Labs hosted API node cluster,
  backed by a load balancer; rate-limited

#### Example `lunul` command-line configuration

To connect to the `mainnet-beta` Cluster using the Lunul CLI:

```shell
lunul config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.lunul.com
```

### Mainnet beta rate limits

- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP: 100
- Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP for a single RPC: 40
- Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 40
- Maximum connection rate per 10 seconds per IP: 40
- Maximum amount of data per 30 seconds: 100 MB

> The public RPC endpoints are not intended for production applications. Please

## Common HTTP Error Codes

- 403 -- Your IP address or website has been blocked. It is time to run your own
  RPC server(s) or find a private service.
- 429 -- Your IP address is exceeding the rate limits. Slow down! Use the
  [Retry-After](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After)
  HTTP response header to determine how long to wait before making another
  request.
