title: Stake Programming
---

To maximize stake distribution, decentralization, and censorship resistance on
the Lunul network, staking can be performed programmatically. The team and
community have developed several on-chain and offchain programs to make stakes
easier to manage.

#### Stake-o-matic aka Auto-delegation Bots

This offchain program manages a large population of validators staked by a
central authority. The Lunul Foundation uses an auto-delegation bot to
regularly delegate its stake to "non-delinquent" validators that meet specified
performance requirements.

#### Stake Pools

This on-chain program pools together LUN to be staked by a manager, allowing LUN
holders to stake and earn rewards without managing stakes. Users deposit LUN in
exchange for LPL tokens (staking derivatives) that represent their ownership in
the stake pool. The pool manager stakes deposited LUN according to their
strategy, perhaps using a variant of an auto-delegation bot as described above.
As stakes earn rewards, the pool and pool tokens grow proportionally in value.
Finally, pool token holders can send LPL tokens back to the stake pool to redeem
LUN, thereby participating in decentralization with much less work required.
