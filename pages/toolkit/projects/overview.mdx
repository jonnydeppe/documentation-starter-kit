> This is a beta version of the [Lunul Toolkit](/docs/toolkit/), and is

Choose from one of the below scaffolds to generate a new project workspace:

- [Anchor](#anchor) - A popular Rust-based framework for creating Lunul
  programs.
- [`create-lunul-program`](#create-lunul-program) - In-depth workspace
  generator for either Anchor program development or Native programs, including
  JavaScript and Rust clients.
- [Web App Templates](#web-app-template) - Generator for new projects that
  connects a Lunul programs to various frontend stacks, includes wallet
  connector setup.

## Anchor

```shell
anchor init
```

This generates a basic workspace to be able to write an Anchor rust programs,
build, test, and deploy. For more information, read the
[`anchor init` doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/anchor-init).

## Create Lunul Program

```shell
npx create-lunul-program
```

This generates an in-depth workspace for either Anchor program development or
Native program development with either a Javascript Client, Rust Client, or
both. For more information, read the
[`create-lunul-program` doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/lunul-program).

## Web App Template

```shell
npx create-lunul-dapp
```

This initializes a new project that connects a Lunul program to a typescript
frontend with a wallet connector. For more information, read the
[web app template doc](/docs/toolkit/projects/web-app).

## Mobile App Template

```shell
yarn create expo-app --template @lunul-mobile/lunul-mobile-expo-template
```

This is initializing a new project using the Expo framework that is specifically
designed for creating mobile applications that interact with the Lunul
blockchain.

## Update an Existing Project

```shell
npx create-lunul-program
```

You can add the Lunul program scaffold to an existing project by following this
[guide](/docs/toolkit/projects/existing-project).

## Standard Project Layouts

For best practices on program file structure, read this
[guide](/docs/toolkit/projects/project-layout).
